## ‚úîÔ∏è Highlights

- Fulfill all requirements
- good and fancy format of slides and report earns points
- notice content organization of slides and report, may need to discuss the
  content by hardware and software even if in a module
- Slides and report should be intuitive, beautiful, clear tables and schematic
  diagram are welcome

## ‚ö†Ô∏è Precautions

- Consider purchasing spare parts when buying vulnerable components
- focus on project progress
- we should get most design done until week 9. Because we **need to leave time
  for mid-term review**, we need to avoid week 11-13 (or even earlier). However
  demo video is needed in week 15, which means there's only 2 weeks left after
  week 9...
- be care of team communication and convergence
- need more hang outs üçª

## üêõ Known Problems

- It seems that webots does not support a multiprocessing controller, since I did not find a way to stop all child processes when simulation is paused.
- A few factors influent webots simulation speed:
  - factors listed by webots [here](https://cyberbotics.com/doc/guide/speed-performance)
  - number of complex sensors initialed
  - get value from sensors frequently
  - `basicTimeStep` in WorldInfo
  - time step of controller
  - output frequently
  - multiprocessing controller

- A few factors influent webots simulation precision:
  - factors listed by webots [here](https://cyberbotics.com/doc/guide/modeling#how-to-make-replicabledeterministic-simulations)
  - webots claims bug on [Orientation Dependent Friction](https://cyberbotics.com/doc/guide/general-bugs#orientation-dependent-friction)
  - very high `basicTimeStep` or time step of controller
  - too complex world
  - performance of the computer...
    - I suppose there is delay in the queues when the computer overloads üòì

## Solution (WIP)

### System

#### Structure

The **system** sets up **3 child processes**, one for chassis controlling, one for decision, one for detection.

> gray boxes are shared variables between processes

![](doc/system.svg)

#### Communication

##### Queue

Four queues, **signal_queue**, **command_queue**, **sensors_queue**, **motors_queue** are used for communications between processes. Although it seems when there is only two endpoints to communicate, [`Pipe()` is a faster choice](https://stackoverflow.com/a/8463046/10088906), but it seems the code could be prettier with `Queue()`.

‚ùóÔ∏è notice that once `Queue.get()` is used, one item in the queue is taken out and returned, which means **it is not in the queue anymore** and you could not get it again with `Queue.get()`. `Queue.empty()` could be used to detect whether it is empty.

##### Shared variables

A few shared variables are created to share some flags and signals between processes. So far `flag_patio_finished`, `flag_pause`, `key` are used.

üìö [document for `multiprocessing.Value()`](https://docs.python.org/2/library/multiprocessing.html#multiprocessing.Value)

[Here](https://docs.python.org/2/library/array.html#module-array) is a list of one character typecode can be used in `multiprocessing.Value()` to determine type of the shared variable.

#### How it ends

the main process ends when `flag_patio_finished` turns to **True**. Now all three child processes are set to **daemonic child process** by `Process.daemon = True`, therefore, [the child processes will be terminated as soon as the main process completes](https://stackoverflow.com/a/25391156/10088906).

‚ùóÔ∏èNote that the main process could NOT exit until all queues are closed.

### Visual & Sensor

üìë [Basic usage of several sensors](doc/Sensor.md)

The illustration of the signals we get:
| Name             | Data Type                   | Description                                                  |
| ---------------- | --------------------------- | ------------------------------------------------------------ |
| Position         | [`float`, `float`, `float`] | The position of the robot which is same with **translation** |
| Speed            | `float`                     | A float in m/s                                               |
| Bridge_Detection | `bool`                      | If the bridge is in the right position, return **True**      |
| Gate_Detection   | `bool`                      | If the bridge is in the right position, return **True**      |
| Color            | `str`                       | The predefined string that indicate the color                |
| Direction_x      | `float`                     | Ranges of **(-180, 180]**. Indicating the degree that the head deviate from x-axis |
| Direction_-z     | `float`                     | Ranges of **(-180, 180]**. Indicating the degree that the head deviate from -z-axis |
| Path_Direction   | `float`/`None`              | Range of approximately [-54.88, 54.88]. A float number that indicates the degree that the path-direction deviates from the head direction. If there is no path, `None` is returned. |

‚ö†Ô∏è Noticing that, the right deviation is positive and the left deviation is negative.
‚ö†Ô∏è Noticing that, the original signal of bridge and gate detection is `False`. Once the object is detected, the corresponding signal will turn to `True` and the detection function will not process again.

## Development Strategy

A regular automatic system development looks like thisüëá

![](doc/regular_development.svg)

But since **we don't have much experience** and **we don't have very long time**, we do it like thisüëá, start from the two green circles **at the same time**, which saves our time and gives us more chances to adjust the design.

## Project Specifications

First a homemade simulation environment, a.k.a. the patio is needed.

The required patio is shown below. Explicit labeled measurements can not be changed.

‚ùóÔ∏è the green and red boxes are just for illustration, should not really appear.

![](doc/patio.png)

| Item   | Measurement                          |
| ------ | ------------------------------------ |
| Rover  | maximum of 50x50 cm                  |
| Bridge | 100 cm wide, 3 m long                |
| Arch   | 100 cm wide, 100 cm high (suggested) |

## Tasks

### Task1

From the start point get to the first red box following the line.

üí° although there should not really be a red box, but can be set and measured by distance.

### Task2

Release a kiwi into the pond when the orange box is detected.

### Task3

Detect the bridge and go across it, the get to the right of the trees.

üí° Here a beacon could be used to avoid tree recognition.

### Task4

Detect the arch and get through it. Then follow the line to the color box.

### Task5

recognize color of the color box and follow the line in same color to the end.

üí° Color of the color box could be set manually.
