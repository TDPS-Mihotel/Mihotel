## ✔️ Highlights

- Fulfill all requirements
- good and fancy format of slides and report earns points
- notice content organization of slides and report, may need to discuss the
  content by hardware and software even if in a module
- Slides and report should be intuitive, beautiful, clear tables and schematic
  diagram are welcome

## ⚠️ Precautions

- Consider purchasing spare parts when buying vulnerable components
- focus on project progress
- we should get most design done until week 9. Because we **need to leave time
  for mid-term review**, we need to avoid week 11-13 (or even earlier). However
  demo video is needed in week 15, which means there's only 2 weeks left after
  week 9...
- be care of team communication and convergence
- need more hang outs 🍻

## Development Strategy

A regular automatic system development looks like this👇

![](doc/regular_development.svg)

But since **we don't have much experience** and **we don't have very long time**, we do it like this👇, start from the two green circles **at the same time**, which saves our time and gives us more chances to adjust the design.

## Project Specifications

First a homemade simulation environment, a.k.a. the patio is needed.

The required patio is shown below. Explicit labeled measurements can not be changed.

❗️ the green and red boxes are just for illustration, should not really appear.

![](doc/patio.png)

| Item   | Measurement                          |
| ------ | ------------------------------------ |
| Rover  | maximum of 50x50 cm                  |
| Bridge | 100 cm wide, 3 m long                |
| Arch   | 100 cm wide, 100 cm high (suggested) |

## Tasks

### Task1

From the start point get to the first red box following the line.

💡 although there should not really be a red box, but can be set and measured by distance.

### Task2

Release a kiwi into the pond when the orange box is detected.

### Task3

Detect the bridge and go across it, the get to the right of the trees.

💡 Here a beacon could be used to avoid tree recognition.

### Task4

Detect the arch and get through it. Then follow the line to the color box.

### Task5

recognize color of the color box and follow the line in same color to the end.

💡 Color of the color box could be set manually.

## Solution (WIP)

The **controller** is a python program using up to **3 processes**, one for movement, one for visual detection and may be one for distance detection.

The **chassis** of the rover is size of **15cm*45cm**, with wheels which diameter is **10cm**. The max speed of the rover is not decided yet. It is a **4WD** chassis, which mean speed of each wheel is separately defined.

![](doc/rover.jpg)

The **feeding device** acts like a garbage truck dumping trash, we dump the kiwi by raising one side of the kiwi holder to let the kiwi slides down.

Our **line detector** works like this:

1. Filtering the original picture to denoise then get the gradient distribution of the picture.
2. Cut the whole picture into N rows averagely. (N=4 in current code)
3. For each segmentation of the picture, for each the point whose magnitude of gradient is greater than the threshold (15 in current code), classify them according to the direction of their gradient. (from 1° to 360°)
4. For each segmentation of the picture, find the direction which contains the most point whose magnitude of gradient exceed the threshold.
5. Average the direction of the N segmentation and it is the direction of the eage of the path. Rotate it by 90° and we could get the direction of the path.

The **decision making** is still working in progress at [#46](https://github.com/TDPS-Mihotel/Mihotel/issues/46)
