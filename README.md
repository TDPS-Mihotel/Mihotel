## ✔️ Highlights

- Fulfill all requirements
- good and fancy format of slides and report
- notice content organization of slides and report, may need to discuss the
  content by hardware and software even if in a module
- Slides and report should be intuitive, beautiful, clear tables and schematic
  diagram are welcome

## ⚠️ Precautions

- Consider purchasing spare parts when buying vulnerable components
- focus on project progress
- we should get most design done until week 9. Because we **need to leave time
  for mid-term review**, we need to avoid week 11-13 (or even earlier). However
  demo video is needed in week 15, which means there's only 2 weeks left after
  week 9...
- be care of team communication and convergence
- need more hang outs😏

## Issues

### Sensor

- there's metro pipe under the patio, geomagnetic sensor is greatly interfered
- image identification is affected much by light, ground wetness
  - insufficient light causes underexposure, too much light causes overexposure
  - color change of ground caused by rain may affect this

## 项目内容

项目为在东湖边两个露台展开的各三个任务. 下面简称露台1, 2的一系列任务为**p1**, **p2**.

### 现场展示

现场展示一个patio的过程.

### 答辩

答辩由`30分钟PPT` (p1p2内容都要包含, **demo视频时间算在这30分钟里**) 和`10分钟Q&A`组成

💡 30分钟看似很多, 但之前有些组是每个人都说几句所以讲到了**四十多分钟** (超时一些不要紧)

💡 demo视频视角完全由我们决定, 因此完全可以有遥控完成, 出错了就剪辑等操作

❗️ 虽然demo视频只需要一个, 但在答辩前几天才会知道抽中了哪个patio, 建议两个都做. (视频时间建议2-3min)

![](doc/project_content/donghu.png)

- 下列图示中`绿条`为一个任务的起始点
- `红条`为一个任务的终止点
- `粗绿条`和`粗红条`分别为一个patio的起始点和终止点
- `紫色标号`为一些小车需按顺序经过的点

💡 每个patio可以设置至多**两个**信标. 虽然问上一届信标本身没什么限制 (即可以考虑自制GPS), 建议用标定板做信标.

### Patio 1

![](doc/project_content/patio1.png)

#### Task 1

![](doc/project_content/p1t1.png)

由`标号1`自主走到`标号6`

#### Task 2

![](doc/project_content/p1t23.png)

在`标号7`处右转过小木桥, 木桥左边界 (照片视角) 对其对面台阶右边界.  `标号7`处考虑设置一个信标.

❗️ 木桥较窄 (约**0.45m**)而长 (约**2.2m**), 上桥前如果不调整好进入角度很有可能**中途掉落**.

#### Task 3

小车下桥后在遇到的第二条轨迹处 (`标号8`) 左转, 通过牌坊. `信标8`处考虑设置一个信标.

### Patio 2

![](doc/project_content/patio2.png)

#### Task 1

![](doc/project_content/p2t1.png)

从起始点走到`标号1`, 识别此处的提示色块, 然后到达同色色块处.

💡 色块共有红, 绿, 蓝三种颜色.

#### Task 2

![](doc/project_content/p2t2.png)

从任务1结束点以不违背总体要求的方式移动到斜槽处(`标号2`). 此处考虑使用两个信标或者利用花坛和水池. 然后将一开始携带的鱼食想法子弄到斜槽上.

❗️ `标号2`是这面栏杆从右数第二个这样的洞.

#### Task 3

到达`紫条`处, 发送包含以下信息的443MHz射频信号:

- 队名
- 队伍编号
- 当前时间 (24小时制)

❗️ 我后来确认了一下不是蓝牙信号, 但也只需要一个HC-12射频模块就可以了.

等待确认收到信息后继续前进到达`粗红条`处. (下图花坛处)

## 报销流程及要求

学院对于本课程采取**凭发票报账报销政策**，需组员在购买过程中按照学院要求开具**增值税发票**.

具体报账要求详见 📑[**报账.md**](doc/报账.md)

## Tutorial on using Zenhub

### Workspace
- ZenHub Workspaces are built using GitHub repositories. When a Workspace is created, each "card" on the Board represents a **GitHub Issue or Pull Request**.
- Move the cursor onto the **Workspace region** and slide the mouse wheel to **look through the tasks**.

#### New Issues
This workspace is created for **Newly created Issues** which requires to be done.

![](doc/Tutorial_Zenhub/NewIssues.png)

#### Epics
ZenHub Epics bundle **similar groups of Issues together**, providing a **visual progress bar** of work across related or dependent Issues. This panel can be regarded as a **group panel**, each group will have their own Epic panel containing their design tasks.

![](doc/Tutorial_Zenhub/Epics.png)

#### Help Wanted

The function of this workspace is exactly what it looks like. This panel contains the **problems which requires suggestions or solution from each member of Team Mihotel**.

![](doc/Tutorial_Zenhub/HelpWanted.png)

#### In progress
This panel shows **what the team is currently working on**.

![](doc/Tutorial_Zenhub/InProgress.png)

#### Back Log

- This panel contains the issues which **require to be solved immediately** or the **delayed ones**.

- The issues in Back-Log panel should **be placed by the order of their emergency levels**.

![](doc/Tutorial_Zenhub/BackLog.png)

#### Closed

The **finished tasks** should be moved to this panel.

![](doc/Tutorial_Zenhub/Closed.png)

### Detailed panel operations

#### Establish new issues

This is the most basic and simple step to start our project management.
- New issues can be created by simply clicking on the green bond **New Issue** in the following picture.

![](doc/Tutorial_Zenhub/Establish_newissues.png)

⚠️Generally, team members are supposed to establish issues in Github. Zenhub is just a tool to help us have an eye on our project progress.

#### Panel setting up

This part is one of the most important step to do the project management which is related to the **division of team members** and the **project progress**. Therefore, in order to **develope the project systematically** and **finish the project on time**, it is necessary to learn how to set up the panel.

- The following figure is the panel setting up page, which will appear automatically as soon as the users click on **New Issues** bond.

![](doc/Tutorial_Zenhub/setting_up.png)

##### How to import the content of the issue into the panel

![](doc/Tutorial_Zenhub/import.png)

As we can see here, the left part of the setting up page is the region for the content of the issue, including **Issue Title**, **Comment**, **Overview** and **File Attaching**.

- **Issue Title**

It is obvious that this region is for issue title.

- **Writing a comment & Attaching files**

This region is used for describing the detailed content of the issue, including **Issue content**, **Division of group members** and **The fils which are probably needed to solve the issue**.

- **Preview**

This region is used for **previewing what the panel is about to look like** so that **necessary adjustments can be done before pulling the panel to the pipe line**.

##### Setting of **Labels**

Issues can be divided into **several categories** as shown below. While setting the new issue, remind that **do not forget to mark the issue with labels** so that the team members are able to figure out what exactly category this issue belongs to. This can improve our efficiency.

![](doc/Tutorial_Zenhub/Labels.png)

  ##### How to **evolve the group members into the issue**.

This step is somehow similar to dividing tasks to group members. Als it can be regarded as the function of **@**. It can be simply achieved to evolve the group members by clicking the bond **Asignees** showed below.

![](doc/Tutorial_Zenhub/Assign.png)

##### How to evolve an issue into Epic.

This step is to **classify different issues**. As we have mentioned before, **Epic** is used to store similar or related issues. It is a good habit to classify the issues at the stage of developing an new issue. The newly established issue can be put into a proper Epic by clicking **Epics** bond shown below.

![](doc/Tutorial_Zenhub/Epics_Classify.png)

After Clicking **Epics** bond, the existing Epics will be shown immediately. Simply click the related Epic so that the new issue will be put into this Epic.

#### How to set the emergency level.

- Setting of **High Priority**

At the right part of the setting up page, there is a **pin shape bond**, **on the top**, which represents **Setting this issue as a high priority issue**.
The detailed bond is shown in the following picture.

![](doc/Tutorial_Zenhub/high_priority.png)

- Except forHigh Priority, Issues can be moved freely in the pipe line. So the level of emergency can be simply set by moving issues freely in the pipe line.
